            <h3>About Us</h3>
                <div>
            <p> In the mid 90's, Ehab and Laila Assaf moved to the United States, all the way from Egypt, with the American Dream.
                With plenty of experience in sales and hospitality, and an unwavering passion for cars, the Assaf family opened Ultimate Auto
                Sales in 2011. We are a 100% family owned, small business based out of Greensboro, NC.
                Our family has lived in Greensboro for over 20 years and have always loved the piedmont triad
                area. Since our founding, we have focused on delivering high quality, reliable used cars to our fellow North
                Carolinians at an honest and fair price. The owner, Ehab Assaf is true family man and a car fanatic. As a teenager he worked hard
                to purchase his first car, a bright red 1972 Alfa Romeo. From that moment, Ehab found his passion in automobiles and the auto industry.
                Today, Ehab is the father of 2 young men, Abdurrahman and Abdullah, and the husband of his lovely wife, Laila. The Assaf family and Ultimate
                Auto Sales still call Greensboro their home, til this day.</p>
